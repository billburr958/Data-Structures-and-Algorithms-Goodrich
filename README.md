# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - Goodrich Solutions

A comprehensive collection of solutions to exercises from "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from the Goodrich et al. textbook. The solutions are organized by chapter and include implementations for Reinforcement, Creativity, and Projects exercises.

## Solutions Included

Each chapter directory contains:
- **solutions.py**: Implementations of all exercises (Reinforcement, Creativity, and Projects)
- **tests/**: Unit tests and test runners for the solutions
- **README.md**: Chapter-specific notes and explanations

## Exercise Categories

- **Reinforcement (R-x.y)**: Basic exercises to reinforce chapter concepts
- **Creativity (C-x.y)**: Problems requiring creative application of concepts
- **Projects (P-x.y)**: Larger programming projects integrating multiple concepts

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Running Solutions
Each chapter's solutions can be imported and used individually:

```python
from chapter_01.solutions import is_multiple, minmax, norm

# Test a specific function
result = is_multiple(10, 5)  # Returns True
print(result)
```

### Running Tests
Navigate to a specific chapter and run the test files:

```bash
cd chapter_01/tests
python test_runner.py
```

## Code Style

- All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Functions include comprehensive docstrings
- Alternative implementations are provided where applicable
- Solutions prioritize clarity and educational value over micro-optimizations

## Learning Approach

These solutions represent my learning journey through data structures and algorithms. While I strive for correctness and efficiency, the primary goal is understanding the underlying concepts. Alternative implementations are often included to demonstrate different approaches to the same problem.
